# `compose-wordpress-items`

This python3 script takes a collection of XML files (typically as generated by [`extract-wordpress-items`](./extract-wordpress-items.md)), and constructs a WordPress archive ready for importing.

## Command Line

`compose-wordpress-items` takes the following basic command line.

```bash
python3 {switches} compose-wordpress-items.py input-dir output-filename
```

`input-dir` is the name of the directory to be read. It should contain some number of XML file fragments as prepared by `extract-wordpress-items`. One of them must be named `Header.xml`. If the file formats are not correct, the script will probably crash with an exception.

`output-filename` is the name of the XML file to be written. If not specified, the file is written to standard output.

Recognized switches:

Switch | Function
-------|----------
 `-v`, `--verbose` | Print progress messages.
 `-h`, `--help`    | Print help summary.
 `--include {type}`, `-i {type}` | Include only items with specified value of `wp:posttype`. If not specified, all items are included.
